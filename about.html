                <p>This website initially started out as just a normal summer project based on movies. But then I thought why not do a little something more. I added my written works as a replacement to the movie reviews, sort of like a double display of skill. The website involves all my works till date and can be found in its entirety on the archives page, that is arranged by genres.</p>

                <p>I am a Student in Delhi Pursuing Bachelors Of Technology in IT. This Site is The Summer Project of 2020. Using basic HTML and CSS3, the website tends to involve, backend, JS and Other complementing frameworks and API's in the future. The Site will be regularly Updated with my latest works.</p>

                <p>I first started writing as wanna-be attempt to do something besides academics. Soon it started to grow on me and I realised how good it is to to just vent words into pages that noone will eaver read. And ive been writing eversince. Though the frequency has dropped over the years, i still cant resist to pick up the pen once in a while to vent all my feelings.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>There is no particular genre or form of writing i excel in. I am just a Casual writer and anyone who genuinely writes will easily see that my works are those of a rookie. They usually involve poetry and smetimes a monologue to my self written in third person. I included these in my website because its just too much fun. Also i finally get something to add to my insta and Github Profiles so.... Win-Win.XD.</p>
